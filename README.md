## How to use and run the program
- To log in as an Administrator: Use 'admin1' as the username and 'password' as the password. If selecting Guest, login will be skipped. Important Note: when displaying tables as an Admin, tables with descriptions such as ART_OBJECTS, ARTIST,  or COLLECTIONS will have suboptimal formatting if you choose to 'select *' due to the large descriptions. Therefore, for these tables, it is reccomended to only display a few attributes at a time, and to display the descriptions seperately.
